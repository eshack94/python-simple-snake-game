# Simple Python Snake Game

This project contains no practical purpose, other than for me to learn about
the Pygame library through trial-and-error and personal experimentation.

This project is not licensed or copywrited, so feel free to re-use this as
you wish unless otherwise indicated.

NOTE: This is incomplete, and has some definite rough edges. I plan to
refine it in my free time when I get around to it. This is just a "for-fun"
project, and serves no practical purpose.

##### TODO:
* Add score counter
* Reduce snake speed
* Increase default canvas dimensions
* Fix the "GAME OVER" text overlay.
    * Make text smaller and better aligned; change font.
* Add "R" option to retry to complement the current "Q" option.
    * Currently, you must hit "Q", then restart by launching the program again.
* Pick a better color palette.
* Add borders and more immersive shapes/textures.

## Usage

Make sure your system is running Python 3, then run:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 simple_snake_game.py
```
